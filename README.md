# Jenkins2Email

Converts the test reports published by Jenkins to Tabular text email.

Useful for open source projects that use mailing lists that strip HTML and/or
allow only text in emails.


# Why not use groovy, jelly or jenkins Email-ext plugins?

Because I do not often control the jenkins instance to configure a useful groovy based template ;)
